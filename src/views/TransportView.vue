            <p class="pt-2">It is possible to park for free at Museumspladsen, right next to the main library. 
            The parking lot fills up quickly, so alternatively, you may have to park elsewhere.</p>
            <p class="pt-2">It's free to park for the first two hours in downtown Esbjerg. Some places have time-limited parking.</p>
            <h3 class="pt-16">Paid parking in downtown Esbjerg:</h3>
            <p class="pt-2">There is also a decent parking garage near Streetmekka Esbjerg/Sydvestjysk Hospital. It's rarely full on weekends and could therefore be a parking option.</p>
